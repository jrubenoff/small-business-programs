    <p> \
      As a courtesy, the NJEDA is offering this screening tool (the “Eligibility Wizard”) \
      that lists emergency assistance programs that you may decide to consider based \
      upon information you provide about your organization. \
    </p> \
    <p> \
      To apply for a program, you need to apply through the appropriate administering \
      agency. The Eligibility Wizard will provide suggestions on how to apply for any \
      benefit on this website but cannot guarantee eligibility and does not reserve any funding \
      or a place in any application queue. The administering agency \
      will determine all eligibility requirements upon your submission of an \
      application to that agency for the respective program. \
    </p> \
    <p> \
      The information you share for purposes of this Eligibility Wizard will be \
      anonymous and may be shared with NJ State agencies to improve access to \
      benefits and programs. \
