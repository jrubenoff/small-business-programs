            <p>
              The COVID-19 outbreak is causing extraordinary disruption for companies
              and non-profits across the Garden State.
              The NJEDA wants to make it easy for organizations to understand what support
              programs are available to you to help stabilize your operations and
              get back on a pathway to growth.
            </p>
            <p>
              This is a beta version of the Eligibility Wizard that focuses on newly announced State Emergency
              Assistance
              programs and the SBA disaster loan program. We will be updating it regularly as new federal, state, local,
              and philanthropic programs become available.

              <p>
                Community Development Financial Institutions (CDFIs) play a critical role in
                providing access to financing tools and resources to businesses and individuals
                that have difficulty accessing the traditional banking sector. Specifically,
                the NJEDA has created two programs
                (<a href="https://faq.business.nj.gov/en/articles/3835240"
                  target="_blank">https://faq.business.nj.gov/en/articles/3835240</a>),
                the <strong>CDFI Emergency Assistance Grant Program</strong>
                and the <strong>CDFI Loan Loss Reserve Fund</strong> to help local CDFI’s scale their lending
                to micro and small businesses, especially in communities and business segments
                that are traditionally underserved.
              </p>
              <p>
                You can reach out directly to a CDFI to see if you would be eligible for any
                of their State-supported and non-State supported financing programs. Click the

                Often one of the most reliable sources of financing for micro, small, and medium-sized
                businesses is their traditional business banking partner. Many banks in New Jersey work
                with the NJEDA to provide low cost financing to micro, small, and medium-sized enterprises.
